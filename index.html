    /* 
    PROBLEM 1: Create an array that contains all the primitives (ie. boolean, number, string, null and undefined) using an array literal
    */
    //ENTER YOUR CODE HERE
     
    /* 
    PROBLEM 2: Create an array containing numbers from 1 to 5. Replace each number in the array with the corresponding value spelled out in words (e.g one, two, ..., five).
    */
    //ENTER YOUR CODE HERE
    
     /* 
    PROBLEM 3: To the array created in PROBLEM 2, add the number 'six' to index 6. Print to the console the updated array
    */
    //ENTER YOUR CODE HERE

    /* 
    PROBLEM 4: Create an empty array (sea) using an array literal, then assign values of 'sponge', 'star fish', 'plankton' and 'squid' to index 1, 2, 3 and 4 respectively. 
    TODO: remove after review
    MOTIVATION: show how you can add elemets to an array with the index; eg array[1] = 'some element'
    */
    //ENTER YOUR CODE HERE

    /* 
    PROBLEM 5 (DEBUGGING): We are trying to print to the console all the creatures in the array created in PROBLEM 4 but for some reason, we see "undefined" among the list.
    Fix this so that the output on the console makes sense.
    TODO: remove after review
    MOTIVATION: show risks associated with method in problem 4; Remind learners of how indexing works in JS - starts at 0;
